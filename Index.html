    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am deeply passionate about education, governance, and youth leadership, striving to drive meaningful change through innovation and policy. As the Executive Director of AZMUN Foundation, I advocate for youth representation, global diplomacy, and debate-driven solutions. My research includes AI-driven early diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s and algae-based biofuels, attracting investor interest at a science exhibition.</p>
        <p>An accomplished debater, I have won multiple awards, including Best Delegate and Best Position Paper at GIISMUN Tokyo 2023, and first place in a school-wide debate among 400 students. I have also represented my school in national and international tournaments, including the National Debate Tournament in Singapore.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I have played at the state level in basketball and co-lead DMUN as Co-Executive Director. My commitment to policy extends to my participation in the Youth Indian Model Parliament, where I was selected for the regional rounds. I am dedicated to bridging knowledge with action, empowering young minds, and shaping impactful global solutions.</p>
